<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Git is most popular version control system. It was first introduced by Linus Torvalds. It is used by many major software companies for software development. Git is a essential tools that every software developer should know. Git is an open source project.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-version-control-system-vcs">What is Version Control System (VCS)</h3>
<p>A version control system (VCS) allows you to track the history of a collection of files. It supports creating different versions of this collection. Each version captures a snapshot of the files at a certain point in time and the VCS allows you to switch between these versions. These versions are stored in a specific place, typically called a repository.</p>
<p>You may, for example, revert the collection of files to a state from 2 days ago. Or you may switch between versions of your files for experimental features. The process of creating different versions (snapshots) in the repository is depicted in the following graphic. Please note that this picture fits primarily to Git. Other version control systems like Concurrent Versions System (CVS) don’t create snapshots of the files but store file deltas.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-github-repository">Configuring github repository</h3>
<p>Configure user information for all git repository. We can also configure other information like, Setting default editor, setting default color of editor, color highlighting, and etc.</p>
<code>
</code><p>git config --global <a href="http://user.name">user.name</a> “XYZ”</p>
<p>git config --global user.email <a href="mailto:%22XYX@hello.com">"XYX@hello.com</a>"</p>

<h3 id="gitignore">Gitignore</h3>
<p>.gitignore is file that, contain list of files which are suppose to be ignore by git commands. If .gitignore contain files <a href="http://A.py">A.py</a>, B.js, C.java then if we add all files in directiry into git using “git add .” then this files will be ignored.</p>
<p>We can still add this ignored files into staging area by using (git add --force []).</p>
<h3 id="git-init">Git init</h3>
<p>init is used for creating new local repository.</p>
<h3 id="git-status">Git status</h3>
<p>git status command is used for getting the status of all files in staging. The status command is used to display the state of the working directory and the staging area. It allows you to see which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren?t being tracked by Git. It does not show you any information about the committed project history. For this, you need to use the git log. It also lists the files that you’ve changed and those you still need to add or commit.</p>
<h3 id="git-commit">Git commit</h3>
<p>Commit command is used in two scenarios. They are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Git commit -m</strong></p>
<p>This command changes the head. It records or snapshots the file permanently in the version history with a message.</p>
<p><strong>Git commit -a</strong></p>
<p>This command commits any files added in the repository with git add and also commits any files you’ve changed since.</p>
<h3 id="git-push">Git push</h3>
<p>It is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is an act of transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It’s the complement to git fetch, but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches on comparatively pushing exports commits to remote branches. Remote branches are configured by using the git remote command. Pushing is capable of overwriting changes, and caution should be taken when pushing.</p>
<h3 id="git-pull">git pull</h3>
<p>Pull command is used to receive data from GitHub. It fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.</p>
<h3 id="git-merge">Git merge</h3>
<p>This command is used to merge the specified branch?s history into the current branch.</p>
<h3 id="git-branch">Git branch</h3>
<p>This command lists all the branches available in the repository.</p>
<h3 id="git-remote">Git remote</h3>
<p>Git Remote command is used to connect your local repository to the remote server. This command allows you to create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. These connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories. This command doesn’t provide real-time access to repositories.</p>
